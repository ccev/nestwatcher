# Geocofing

Poracle supports four different geocoding services. 

## Poracle

That's the public hosted nominatim server. Completely free and without ratelimits.

## Nominatim

That's the option for a self hosted nominatim server.

## Google Maps

### Api key

Please log in to [Google Developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and make sure you have the following API's enabled:  
   
* Google Maps Javascript API 
* Google Maps Geocoding API
* Google Reverse Geocoding API
* Google Static Maps API  

You can test if your API key manually by adding your key to the below urls:  

#### Geocoding

```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Tallinn+Estonia&key=YOURKEYHERE
```  

#### Reverse Geocoding

```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=59.432982,24.7535747&key=YOURKEYHERE
```

#### Static Maps

```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=59.432982,24.7535747&markers=color:red|59.432982,24.7535747&maptype=roadmap&zoom=15&size=250x175&key=YOURKEYHERE
```  

## OSM

OpenStreetMap offers a public nominatim server as well, but ratelimits very hard which makes it almost unuseable with PoracleJS.
