## Tools

Nest Watcher comes with a few useful tools that help you with renaming parks. I highly recommend [to fetch new names from OSM](https://ccev.github.io/nestwatcher/tools/fetching-new-names.html) after you first got your parks written to the DB. Then, you can to easily [define details for all parks using Disocrd](https://ccev.github.io/nestwatcher/tools/fetching-new-names.html).
